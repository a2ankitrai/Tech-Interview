# Introduction

It is critical for an employer to assess how well one fits into the company in the interview process since employees who are a strong cultural fit have higher job satisfaction, superior job performance, and are more likely to stay with the company.

Behavioral Interviews are a proven way to assess a person’s motivations, characteristics and cultural fit in an organization. They reveal a person’s ability to adapt, communicate and grow. Unlike technical questions, there is no right or wrong answers. The candidates are often asked how they handled different situations.
