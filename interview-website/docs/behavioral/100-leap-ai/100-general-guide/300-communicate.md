# Communicate

No matter if you are in engineering, sales, or marketing, communication plays a critical role for you to be effective at work. Thus, the interviewers will try their best to get a read on your articulation and communication style.

Explain your solution. The interviewers definitely care whether they have the right answer to the technical questions, but they care even more about your thinking process. Please make sure to explain the thought process why you are approaching the problems in this way.

Be Succinct. Be direct with your answers, especially for your past experience. People care less about all the glory background. Please just share enough so that the interviewer can truly understand what you try to convey. Of course, overly terse is bad too since the interview may not have enough context to appreciate the complexity and significance of your past successes.

Listening. Demonstrate active listening skills, ask clarification questions if needed. Do not rush to answer a question if the interviewer is still trying to explain. By listening, you can get a better sense of what your interviewers are interested in so that you can tailor your response including selecting the right examples to resonate better with the interviewer. Of course, the last thing you want to do is to argue with an interviewer.
