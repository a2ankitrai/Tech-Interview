# Prepare. Prepare. Prepare.

The most common mistake in an interview is that people come unprepared. Sometimes, a candidate does not even have a reasonable understanding of what the company does, or is unable to explain what she has done in the past concisely. This can be addressed by spending some time to prepare.

- Research the company and your interviewers. It will show that you have done your homework thoroughly. Only after considerable research, you can ask questions with great insights and have a meaningful conversation with the interviewers.

- Get a list of 10 interesting questions. Asking the right questions is not only a great way to get the right information for you to assess the company and the opportunity, but also a great way to demonstrate your insights and unique perspective.

- Practice. Practice. Practice. You are almost certain to encounter certain questions, for example, a quick overview of your recent project, your top strengths, your development areas, why you apply to this role. You should have very crisp answers to these questions.
